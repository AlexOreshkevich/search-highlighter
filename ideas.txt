BreakIterator based segmenter.  It'll look like the PostingsHighligher.

Interface for weighing all hits in a snippet together.  Probably only useful for BasicScoreOrderSnippetChooser but that'll be similar to PostingsHighlighter too.

Hook in DefaultSimilarityTermWeigher to Elasticsearch when there is more then one term.

Maybe real phrase detection.  Maybe real span support.

Probably poor man's phrase detection - just boost things that are near one another a bit.

Special HitEnum for testing that asserts that you don't go beyond the end.  I know Lucene uses something like this.

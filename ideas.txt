Interface for weighing all hits in a snippet together.  Probably only useful for BasicScoreOrderSnippetChooser but that'll be similar to PostingsHighlighter too.

Maybe real phrase detection.  Maybe real span support.

Probably poor man's phrase detection - just boost things that are near one another a bit.

Special HitEnum for testing that asserts that you don't go beyond the end.  I know Lucene uses something like this.
